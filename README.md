This is a football tournament prediction model created using ML. 

Using Decision Tree Algorithm, we have predicted the number of goals each player will score in a football tournament season (38 games). 
We use features such as age, appearances, goals per match, etc. to predict the performance of each player.

## Working of the project
We take important features from the dataset and use Decision Tree to predict the number of goals each player will score based on those features.

Then based on these predicted goals, we find out the potential ratings of these players out of 100

And we convert this data into a new .csv file which we can read by using the Python script we created

The .exe file helps us look at the new dataframe containing the predicted data

## Accessing the results
